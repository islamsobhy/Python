Python supports various built-in data types that you can use to store and manipulate data in your programs. Here's a summary of the main data types in Python:
1. Numeric Types:
  int: Represents whole numbers, both positive and negative (eg., 1,2,50,-100).
  float: Represents real numbers (numbers with a decimal point) (eg., 1.55).
  complex: Represents complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (eg., a = 3 + 2j).

2. Boolean Type:
  bool: Represents either a True or False value.

3. Sequence Types:
  list: An ordered collection of elements, indexed by integers (eg.,  [1, 2, 3, 4])
  tuple: An ordered collection of elements, similar to a list, but immutable.
  range: Represents a range of numbers and is used primarily in for loops.

4. Mapping Type:
  dict: A collection of key-value pairs, also known as an associative array or hash map.

5. Set Types:
  set: An unordered collection of unique elements.
  frozenset: An immutable version of a set.

6. Text Sequence Type:
  str: Represents a string of characters.

7. Binary Types:
  bytes: Represents an immutable sequence of bytes.
  bytearray: Similar to bytes, but mutable.
  memoryview: Allows accessing the internal data of an object that supports the buffer protocol.

8. None Type:
  None: Represents the absence of a value or null value.
  These are the primary built-in data types in Python, but you can also define custom data types using classes and other Python features.
